# Darkest Hour

## Overview

This is an old-fashioned text adventure game, hopefully the first of many.

## Story

Halloween is almost here, but something is happening that's much scarier than the annual haunted house at the fire hall.  There are rumors of a vampire - a real one - attacking people at night.  Of course most people think it's just silly; who wouldn't?  But people are going missing, and others swear they've seen it.  It's up to you to track down this vampire, stop it if possible.  The question is, will you even survive the night?

## How to play

1. Download the version that matches the type of computer you're using.  The different versions can be found in the "bin" folder.
2. If you're on an 8-bit computer, load the file; if you're on Windows, double-click it or press Enter on it; if you're on Linux, you know what to do. :)
3. From here, it's all about the keyboard.  You play by typing stuff.  To send an instruction to the game, type a letter or number and then press Enter (Return).  The game comes with complete instructions on what to do from there.

## A note about the Apple 2 disk

On the Apple 2, instead of pressing Return, you may have to press Space a bunch of times after typing a command.  This is due to a bug in the C compiler I used that only affects the Apple 2.  I tried several different ways to fix it, but none have worked.  But the game does run on my Apple 2 emulator, that minor catch aside.
